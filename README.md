# my_portfolio_website
A repo for the module 2 challenge: making our own professional portfolio
Description: This is a professional Portfolio Website I intend to deploy in order for my future employers to be able to more easily access my projects.

There are currently three sections that allow employers to be able to access my information: the About me, Projects, and Contact me sections, which will be explained more.

# About me: This section describes a short bio about myself, why Iâ€™m taking this course and my coding experience up to this point. 

# Projects: This section displays the projects I have and will yet to work on. (because I currently lack any projects to display, clicking the links will take the user to gmail.com)

# Contact Me: this section displays multiple ways of contact in addition to a link to my linkedIn profile
